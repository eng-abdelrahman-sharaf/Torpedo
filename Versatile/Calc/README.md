# Arduino Project Report:  DC Motor Rotation, Servo Sweeping, and PIR Sensor LED Flashing


### Project Overview

This Arduino project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of integrating multiple components to perform distinct tasks. The primary components used in this project are a DC motor, a servo motor, and a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor. The DC motor is controlled to rotate repeatedly, the servo motor performs a sweeping motion, and the PIR sensor is utilized to detect motion and trigger an LED flash.

### Components Used

1. *Arduino Board*: The central microcontroller that coordinates all the tasks.
2. *DC Motor*: Used for repeated rotation.
3. *Servo Motor*: Executes a sweeping motion back and forth.
4. *PIR Sensor*: Detects motion and triggers an LED.
5. *LED*: Flashes when motion is detected by the PIR sensor.
